```

Basic CandleStickChart graph
```{r}
plot(x7)
candleChart(NSEI,theme = "white")
```

CandleStick chart using Chatseries
```{r}
chartSeries(NSEI,up.col = "green",dn.col = "red",theme = "white",name="NIFTY INDEX")
```

Add indicator SMA/EMA to graph (Simple moving avg/Exponential moving avg)
EMA is more accurate compared to SMA since it gives more weightage to recent days where as
SMA treats all prior days with same weightage 
n=10,20,100 get previous 10,20,100 days average. Lesser the value of n more accurate is the line
```{r}
chartSeries(NSEI,up.col = "green",dn.col = "red",theme = "white",name="NIFTY INDEX")
addSMA(n=5,col = "blue")
addSMA(n=10,col="black")
addEMA(n=5,col="green")
```

Add ROC indicator 
```{r}
chartSeries(NSEI,up.col = "green",dn.col = "red",theme = "white",name="NIFTY INDEX")
addROC(n=5)
```
